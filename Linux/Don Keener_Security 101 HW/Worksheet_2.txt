Cybersecurity Threat Landscape (Part 2 - Akamai)

1. DDOS attack events from January 2019 to September 2019 largely targeted the gaming industry.

2. Almost 50% of unique targets for DDoS attacks from January 2019 to September 2019 largely targeted the financial services industry.

3. Microsoft, PayPal, DHL, DropBox, are the top phishing targets.

4. Credential stuffing is the automated injection of breached username/password pairs in order to fraudulently gain access to user accounts. This is a subset of the brute force attack category: large numbers of spilled credentials are    automatically entered into websites until they are potentially matched to an existing account, which the attacker can then hijack for their own purposes.

5. U.S.A. is the #1 source of credential abuse attacks.  Russia is #2.

6. U.S.A. is the #1 source of web application attacks.  Rusia is #2.

7. What was happening durning the possible DDoS attack in Asia was a large amount HTTP requests to the URL.  The team believed that the source of the attack was a massive DDoS attack.  The team actually discovered that it was not an attack and that it was a warranty tool gone haywire.  A fix wash pushed within hours to all of the affected systems.

8. An example of performance issues due to bot traffic is the origin server becomes overloaded ant the site becomes slow or unavailable for legitamate users.

9. The catagories of good bots are "Search Engine Crawlers", "Web Archives", "Search Engine Optimization,Audience Analytics, and "Site Monitoring Services" and "Content Aggregators"

10. Two evasion techniques that malicious bots use are:

a. Altering the User Agent or other HTTP header values, allowing the bot to impersonate widely used browsers, mobile applications, or even known good bots.

b. Tamper with browser properties, spoofing known fingerprint characteristics.
